Usage: 

Type "calc".

Then type expressions into the calculator using the *, +, -, and / operators.
Simplecalc recognizes the ( ) enclosures and will assume that a number
adjacent to a parenthesis implies multiplication.

Limitations:

- Only *,/,+ and - operations supported.
- Floating-point only with no rounding.
- Syntax errors will cause the application to quit.
